        <p class="description">
          I started playing guitar when I was 14, so that I could learn Smashing
          Pumpkins songs and be in a band. Started learning jazz when I
          was 
          16, to be in my high school jazz band, and that is what I like to 
          play currently.
        </p>
        <p>
          I ended up getting a B.M.,
          M.M., and D.M.A. in music from the University of Southern California,
          and have taught music courses such as guitar class, private lessons, music theory, history of rock, history of jazz, jazz ensembles, music appreciation, ear training, musicianship and others at Musicians Institute, Chaffey College, College of the Desert, CSULA, University of Southern California, and Whittier College since 2013.

        <p class="description">
          My approach to lessons can vary depending on the studentâ€™s skill level
          and goals, but across all levels, I place a focus on maximizing our
          playing time. I encourage students to figure things out for
          themselves, and I strive to model good practice technique, in order to
          students to effectively improve at their instrument.

        <h1 class="sub-titles">Pricing and Terms</h1>
        <p class="description">
          I will travel to the student's home for lessons. I have a base fee
          of $40 per 30 min lesson if within a 10 min drive from Old Torrance.
          I will determine the drive time based on whatever google maps says
          for the time of day for our agreed meeting time, and it will be fixed
          from there.
        </p>
        
        <p class="description">
          I will change an additional $1.00 per minute for every minute after
          10. For example, if you live 15 minutes away and want a 30 minute
          lesson... $40 + $5 = $45.00.
        </p>
        
        <p class="description">
          I accept Venmo or cash for all transactions. Pay in packages or one
          at a time. Whatever works best for you!
        </p>
        
        <p class="description">
          I will do my best to give 24 hours notice for any cancellations, and
          I expect students to do the same. I do not charge cancellation fees.
        </p>
        
        <p class="description">
          Any other questions, I'm excited to hear from you!
